# Data Processing Project

## Description

This repository contains a Python project that fetches, processes, and saves data from an API. The project is modular, with each functionality encapsulated in separate modules.

## Features

- Fetch data from a specified API using basic authentication.
- Process the fetched data (dummy processing in this case).
- Save the processed data to a file.
- Logging for various stages of execution to track progress and errors.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main script that orchestrates the operations.
- `fetcher.py`: Module to fetch data from the API.
- `processor.py`: Module to process the fetched data.
- `saver.py`: Module to save the processed data to a file.
- `logger.py`: Module to set up logging.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/data-processing-project.git
    cd data-processing-project
    ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install requests
    ```

3. **Run the main script:**
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## Logging

Each module logs its activities to a separate log file (e.g., `fetcher.log`, `processor.log`, `saver.log`), including:
- Data fetching attempts and successes.
- Data processing attempts and outcomes.
- Errors and warnings.

## Important Note

**Security Reminder:** Hardcoding sensitive information like usernames and passwords in your code is a bad practice and can lead to security vulnerabilities. Always use environment variables or secure vaults to store such information.
